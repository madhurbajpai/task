**`Ques 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? `**\
**`Ans.`** I spent around "12 hours" on the coding. It included setting up the environment, planning, implementing the required features and styling the components.


**`Ques 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.`**\
**`Ans.`** In the recent versions of JavaScript (ES2020), the optional chaining operator (?.) is extremely useful for simplifying access to deeply nested properties. It eliminates the need to manually check for null or undefined values at each level, making the code cleaner and reducing error-prone conditions.

### `const matchesStatus = statusFilter === 'All' ||(statusFilter === 'Completed' && task?.completed) ||(statusFilter === 'Pending' && !task?.completed);`


**`Ques 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?`**\
**`Ans.`** To track down a production performance issue, I would start by analyzing logs. Profiling specific parts of the application would allow me to see where memory or processing power is overused. Iâ€™ve had to address a production performance issue before, where I got with the problem, which was related to inefficient database queries.


**`Ques 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?`**\
**`Ans.`** With more time, I would consider adding:
1. User authentication for a multi-user experience, allowing users to manage their tasks independently.
2. Notifications and reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks.
3. Light Mode and Dark mode and enhanced UI customization for a more personalized experience.
